Problem 58: Spiral primes

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
[37] 36   35   34   33   32  [31]
 38 [17]  16   15   14  [13]  30 
 39  18   [5]   4   [3]  12   29 
 40  19    6    1    2   11   28 
 41  20   [7]   8    9   10   27 
 42  21   22   23   24   25   26 
[43] 44   45   46   47   48   49 
It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. 
If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the percent of primes along both diagonals first falls below percent?
