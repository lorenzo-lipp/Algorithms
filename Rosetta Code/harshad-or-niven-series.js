/* 
Harshad or Niven series

The Harshad or Niven numbers are positive integers â‰¥ 1 that are divisible by the sum of their digits.
For example, 42 is a Harshad number as 42 is divisible by (4 + 2) without remainder.
Assume that the series is defined as the numbers in increasing order.
Implement a function to generate successive members of the Harshad sequence.
Use it to return an array with ten members of the sequence, starting with first Harshad number greater than n.
